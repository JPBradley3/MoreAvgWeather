# MoreAvgWeather

## Description
MoreAvgWeather is a series of Python scrapers that utilize machine learning techniques to predict rainfall in various parts of Seattle's hilly terrain. By analyzing factors such as altitude, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and calculated barometric pressure, the project aims to leverage the known phase changes of water to enhance the accuracy of localized precipitation predictions within the city.

## Features
- **Data Scraping**: Collects weather-related data from various sources pertinent to Seattle's microclimates.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements algorithms to analyze weather patterns and predict rainfall based on multiple meteorological factors.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Considers Seattle's varied altitudes to improve the precision of rainfall predictions across different neighborhoods.
